# CPP_Inline_Function
The inline functions are a C++ enhancement feature to increase the execution time of a program.

Functions can be instructed to compiler to make them inline so that compiler can replace those function definition wherever those are being called.
Compiler replaces the definition of inline functions at compile time instead of referring function definition at runtime.
To make any function as inline, start its definitions with the keyword “inline”.
